We are forking the mainnet locally, this  could be done by just 
adding few lines to the hardhat config. 
If the key belongs to alchemy for the mainnet forking

npx hardhat node --fork https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/<key>

networks: {
  hardhat: {
    forking: {
      url: "https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/<key>",
    }
  }
}
